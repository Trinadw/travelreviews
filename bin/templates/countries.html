		<p>Welcome to Trina's Travels. Growing up in St. Louis, Missouri,
			I was never a big traveler. Other than the occasional visit to family
			down south, I never ventured too far from St. Louis. As a young adult
			my initial travel excursions were all to urban areas of the United
			States. While I enjoyed traveling, I was very safe with my adventures
			going to cities that had a booming travel industry. I did not take my
			first trip overseas until I was 26. My only travel experience was
			within the United States. After settling into my career I decided I
			wanted to travel. After all, I had the job and my finances were
			stable. It was vacation time, right?</p>
		<p>

				width="450" height="230" />So for my first trip overseas in 2001, I
			went to London. It was an awesome trip, but during the cold month of
			March. Regardless of the weather, that trip changed my life. It
			opened me up to the possibilities of the world. In London, I
			experienced other cultures, saw historic pieces dating back
			centuries, and met people from around the world. From that moment on,
			I was hooked on travel. Admittedly, London isn't that big a change
			from the U.S., but I was proud that I had taken the long 8 hour
			flight to see a different country. In most cases, taking a small step
			helps you to make the big leaps. After my trip to London, I was more
			than willing to travel to other countries. All I wanted to do was
			travel, see more of the world, and learn more about the people in it.
			My goal is to travel to every country and meet as many people as I
			can. So far I have visited over 10 countries and will share my
			experiences with you, so that you can motivate yourself to visit the
			same countries or live vicariously through my travels.
		</p>
		<p>Below you will see a list of my vacation spots. I've been lucky
			enough to travel to multiple continents and see some awesome wonders
			of the world. During my travels I've also been able to experience the
			hospitality of multiple cultures. I must say they I have been blessed
			to always encounter people who were more than willing to assist me if
			I had questions or were as genuinely pleased to meet me as I was to
			meet them. Below you will see a list of my vacation spots. Click the
